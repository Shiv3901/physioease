<h2>Scapula</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>scapula</strong>, or <em>shoulder blade</em>, is a large, flat, triangular bone located on the posterior aspect of the ribcage. 
  It connects the humerus (upper arm bone) with the clavicle and plays a key role in shoulder movement and stability.
</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spine of Scapula:</strong> A prominent ridge that separates the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae</li>
  <li><strong>Acromion:</strong> Forms the highest point of the shoulder and connects with the clavicle</li>
  <li><strong>Glenoid Cavity:</strong> A shallow socket that articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint</li>
  <li><strong>Coracoid Process:</strong> A bony projection serving as a muscle attachment point</li>
</ul>

<h3>Muscle Attachments</h3>
<p>
  The scapula provides attachment sites for numerous muscles that support shoulder motion and posture, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supraspinatus</li>
  <li>Infraspinatus</li>
  <li>Subscapularis</li>
  <li>Teres major and minor</li>
  <li>Trapezius and deltoid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clinical Relevance</h3>
<p>
  Scapular dyskinesis, or abnormal movement of the scapula, can contribute to shoulder pain and reduced performance in athletes. 
  Proper scapular positioning and strength are critical in shoulder rehabilitation.
