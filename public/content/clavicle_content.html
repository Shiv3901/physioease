  <h2>Clavicle</h2>

  <p>
    The <strong>clavicle</strong>, commonly known as the <em>collarbone</em>, is a long bone that serves as a strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone).
    It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the shoulder and allowing a wide range of arm movements.

  <h3>Key Functions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Acts as a structural support to keep the arm away from the torso</li>
    <li>Transfers mechanical force from the arm to the central skeleton</li>
    <li>Provides attachment sites for several muscles, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Sternocleidomastoid</li>
        <li>Pectoralis major</li>
        <li>Deltoid</li>
        <li>Trapezius</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Clinical Relevance</h3>
  <p>
    The clavicle is one of the most frequently fractured bones in the body, especially during falls or contact sports.
    Fractures typically occur in the middle third and may require immobilization or surgical intervention depending on severity.
